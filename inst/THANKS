We've benefited from a number of resources when writing the package.
The plm package by Croissant and Millo (2008-2019) was an inspiration.
Additionally, a number of books, blogs, and forum entries on
stackexchange proved to be very resourceful. A notable example is the
book R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan and the related
R package roxygen2.
